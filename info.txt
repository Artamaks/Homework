Task:
  Create a program that reads all 3 files inside data directory. Pull out all numbers from texts:
  Example: 24,901 will be [2, 4, 9, 0, 1] // Only digits from 0 to 9
  Then count sum of all these numbers and show result in console

Hints:
  1. Start from just reading file and join all texts in one data variable
  2. Pull out all numbers using loop to iterate through string. It can be done by trying to convert each symbol
  into number and then validate if it works using Number object static methods. Numbers you can push into array
  3. Sum all numbers in array
  4. Done
